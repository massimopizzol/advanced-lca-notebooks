# advanced-lca-notebooks


### Folder "Course-Material"

Notebooks used in the advanced LCA course (uses Brightway version 2.3 also called "legacy" or simply "brightway2")

These notebooks introduce to the use of the [Brightway2](https://2.docs.brightway.dev/index.html) LCA software. They have been used in multiple editions of the "Advanced LCA" course at Aalborg University. More primitive versions are available at the [B4B](https://github.com/massimopizzol/B4B) repository.

Videos explaining the notebooks are available at [my blog](https://moutreach.science/2022/08/15/teaching-videos.html) together with other introductory LCA teaching videos.

**Disclaimer**: note that both the notebooks and the videos are de-contextualized from the teaching activities that usually integrate them. This teaching activities usually include exercises, Q&A, and more extensive explanations. Therefore, even though most of them can work as a stand-alone resource they were not initially designed as such.


### Folder "Course-Material-bw25"

Includes some of the same content as in the "Course-material" folder but using brightway version 2.5. 

Tutorials on sensitivity and uncertainty analysis use a different approach than in the bw2 version (do not use parameters). 


### Folder "Specific-bw-tasks"

Contains several various short notebooks to perform specific types of LCA analysis tasks in brightway, for example: 
- importing and exporting a database
- performing paired-samples montecarlo simulation
- Global Sensitivity analysis with FAST algorithm
- ...

Some of these notebooks are incomplete or under preparation (See under "work in progress")

Most notebooks were written using bw2.3 version.
